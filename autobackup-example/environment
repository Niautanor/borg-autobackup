# These environment variables are used directly by the borg(1) command. The
# example configuration assumes that you have a restricted user backup on the
# server indicated by host that you can connect to using the (passphraseless)
# ssh-key /home/username/.ssh/backup.
#
# For the server side, you can refer to the deployment section of the borg
# manual which describes all the fun things you can put in the authorized_keys
# file of the backup user to make sure that it can only receive backups.
#
# Please note that the repository will NOT be automatically created if it does
# not exist. You have to do that manually with borg init.
